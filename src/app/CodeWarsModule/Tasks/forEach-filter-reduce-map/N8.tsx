// The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open.
// They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.
//
//   To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7.
//   In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.
//
//   Input
// Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member.
// Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.
//
//   Output
// Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior)
// stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.
//
//   Example
// input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
// output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]
